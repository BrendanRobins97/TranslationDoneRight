Querying Perplexity AI using sonar-pro for: modern game localization features and best practices for Unity games 2024
Unity offers several modern localization features and best practices for game localization in 2024:

1. Built-in Localization Package:
- Supports string and asset localization
- Smart Strings feature for automatic placeholder and plural replacement
- Pseudo-localization for early testing
- Import/export to XLIFF, CSV and Google Sheets[4][7]

2. String Localization:
- Store strings externally in resource files (JSON, XML)
- Use unique string identifiers
- Implement careful string interpolation with numbered/named placeholders[2]

3. Asset Localization:
- Use AssetBundles to swap localized assets (textures, audio, etc.)[5]
- Design UI to accommodate text expansion (up to 35%)[2]

4. Cultural Adaptation:
- Adapt content, images, symbols to target cultures
- Ensure character names and dialogue are culturally appropriate[3]

5. Technical Best Practices:
- Use Unicode (UTF-8/UTF-16) for wide language support
- Handle plurals and grammatical cases
- Implement RTL language support
- Use locale-aware date/time/number formatting[2]

6. Workflow:
- Create a comprehensive localization kit with game context, character profiles, etc.
- Use a localization management tool (e.g. Gridly) for collaboration and automation[2]
- Implement separate translation memories for different projects[2]

7. QA:
- Test localized content display and UI layout
- Verify fonts, date/time formats for each locale[2]

8. Development:
- Use Unity's localization components to reduce manual coding[1]
- Leverage Unity's preloaded locales and language support[1]

Code example for string localization:

```csharp
using UnityEngine.Localization;
using UnityEngine.Localization.Settings;

public class LocalizationExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    public LocalizedString localizedText;

    void Start()
    {
        localizedText.StringChanged += UpdateText;
    }

    void UpdateText(string translatedText)
    {
        // Use the translated text
        Debug.Log(translatedText);
    }
}
```
